## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Weâ€™re using [GitHub discussions in this repo](https://github.com/conda/infra/discussions) as a place to provide a place for [Conda core members and maintainers](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance#teams--roles) to raise issues about the Conda community infrastructure such as:
  * Package hosting (e.g. conda-forge channel on anaconda.org)
  * GitHub organization admin questions and issues
  * Test suite and development setup issues
  * Anything that does not fall into any other project specific buckets (e.g. the [conda issues](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues) or [conda-build issues](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues))
  * etc.

**NOTE: This is not a forum for end user questions!**

Feel also free to:
  * Share ideas about new features and changes you'd like to see
  * Engage with other community members

Please start by creating a discussion first before you open an issue directly.

Welcome others and be open-minded. Remember that this is a community we build together ðŸ’ª.
